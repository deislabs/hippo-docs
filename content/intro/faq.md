## What languages can I use with Hippo? Why isn't my favorite language
supported?

Hippo can serve any WebAssembly module that was compiled with support for [Web
Application System Interface or WASI][wasi].  We provide explicit support (in
`yo-wasm`) for the following languages: **AssemblyScript, C, Rust, and Swift**.
Other languages that can compile to `wasm32-wasi`, like Zig and Grain, will
also work.  You will just need to write your `HIPPOFACTS` file from scratch.

Many other languages are working on their WebAssembly support. But a language
must have support for the WASI specification before it can be used in Hippo.

## What workloads are suited for Hippo?

Considering the [benefits and limitations of WebAssembly][wasm], some workloads
are better suited for running on Hippo than others.  Hippo is designed
specifically for microservices and web applications.
