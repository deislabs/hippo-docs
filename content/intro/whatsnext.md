So you’ve read all the introductory material and have decided you’d like to keep using Hippo. We’ve only just scratched the surface with this intro.

So what’s next?

Well, we’ve always been big fans of learning by doing. At this point you should know enough to start a project of your own and start fooling around. As you need to learn new tricks, come back to the documentation.

We’ve put a lot of effort into making Hippo’s documentation useful, clear and as complete as possible. The rest of this document explains more about how the documentation works so that you can get the most out of it.

(Yes, this is documentation about documentation. Rest assured we have no plans to write a document about how to read the document about documentation.)

## How the Documentation is Organized

Hippo's documentation is broken into chunks designed to fill different needs:

- The [introductory material]({{< relref "../intro" >}}) is designed for people new to Hippo. It doesn't cover anything in depth, but instead gives a high-level overview of the system.
- The [topic guides]({{< relref "../topics" >}}) dive deep into individual parts of Hippo. There are complete guides to Hippo's [usage of WebAssembly]({{< relref "../topics/webassembly.md" >}}) and much more.

Answers to really common questions can be found in the [FAQ]({{< relref "faq.md" >}}).
