We built Hippo to help with two things.

First, we want to make it simple to run applications and services compiled to
WebAssembly. When we make it easy to deploy and test out our ideas, the
WebAssembly community learns how to best run WebAssembly applications in
production. We also make it easier for newcomers to get going. **Hippo is about
growing WebAssembly adoption.**

Second, we want to make it easier for teams to manage their application release
life cycle. Hippo introduces a concept called "Channels" that eases the process
of collaborating on new ideas by automatically deploying your releases based on
their version number. Want to test your idea in a staging environment? Create a
new "Staging" channel and watch Hippo deploy your development builds live.
**Hippo helps promote collaboration.**

Hippo is a powerful platform. We want to make it easy to manage the apps and
services you deploy.

Get started with Hippo in three easy steps.

1. Install Hippo
1. Boot hippo-server
1. Deploy your first application

This guide will help you set up a cluster suitable for evaluation, development
and testing.

## Step 1: Install Hippo

Refer to [Install Hippo]({{< relref "install-hippo.md" >}}).

## Step 2: Boot hippo-server

There are many ways to boot and install hippo-server. You may choose to get up
and running in a cloud environment, or locally on your laptop.

At this time, no documentation for running in a cloud environment is available.
Stay tuned!

If you would like to test on your local machine, follow our guide for [running
locally]({{< relref "running-locally.md" >}}).

## Step 3: Deploy your First Application

Next, [register an account and deploy your first
application]({{< relref "deploy-your-first-application.md" >}}).

## Next Steps

The beginner tutorial ends here. In the meantime, you might want to check out
some pointers on [where to go from here]({{< relref "whatsnext.md" >}}).
