title: HIPPOFACTS Format
description: The HIPPOFACTS file format
type: docs
---

Hippo uses a special file called `HIPPOFACTS` to describe how to map an application to a Wagi service.
A typical `HIPPOFACTS` file does three things:

- It describes an application so that the application can be packaged by Bindle.
- It maps relative URL paths (e.g. `/hello`) to handlers (e.g. `hello.wasm`)
- It attaches supporting files, like CSS, images, or JS, to a particular handler

A `HIPPOFACTS` file must be written in [TOML].
See [Configure an application with HIPPOFACTS][configure] for additional details on how this file is used.

```toml
# Define metadata about the application
[bindle]
  name = "Name of the application"
  version = "1.2.3" # Must be semver v2, without leading v prefix
  description = "Optional description of the application"
  authors = ["Your Name", "Another Name"] # Optional list of application authors

# Define one or more request handlers
[[handlers]]
  route = "/endpoint1" # Request path that should be handled by a WebAssembly module
  name = "bin/myapp1.wasm" # Relative path to a WebAssembly module that should handle the request
  files = ["images/*.jpg", "images/logos/myapp1.png"] # Optional list of files to deploy with the module
```

### \[bindle\]

The bindle section defines metadata about your application:

- **name**: The name of the application
- **version**: The application version. Follows [semver v2] and does not allow a leading v prefix.
- **description**: OPTIONAL. A plaintext description of the application.
- **authors**: OPTIONAL. A list of author names.

### [[handler]]

The handler entries can be repeated as many times as needed.
Handlers define endpoints for your application and the WebAssembly module that should receive requests.

- **route**: The request path. It should start a leading forward slash `/`.
  - If you want to tell a handler to support all _sub-paths_, you can add the `/...` suffix to the route. For example, `/hello/...` will match `/hello/world` and `/hello/wasm/world`.
- **name**: Relative path to the WebAssembly module (`*.wasm` file) that should handle the request.
- **files**: OPTIONAL. A list of relative file paths of static files that should be deployed with the WebAssembly module. These files are available to the module when it is serving requests.
