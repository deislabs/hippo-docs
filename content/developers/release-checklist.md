This guide will guide you (redundancy added for purposes of punnery) on your
journey to release a new version of Hippo.

All releases will be of the form `vX.Y.Z` where `X` is the major version
number, `Y` is the minor version number and `Z` is the patch release number.
This project strictly follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) so
following this step is critical.

It is important to note that this document assumes that the git remote in your
repository that corresponds to <https://github.com/deislabs/hippo> is named
`upstream`. If yours is not (for example, if you've chosen to name it `origin`
or something similar instead), be sure to adjust the listed snippets for your
local environment accordingly.

If you are not sure what your upstream remote is named, use a command like `git
remote -v` to find out.

If you don't have an upstream remote, you can add one easily using the
following command:

```console
git remote add upstream git@github.com:deislabs/hippo
```

We are also going to be adding security and verification of the release process
by providing signature files. We perform this using [GitHub and
GPG](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/about-commit-signature-verification).

If you do not have GPG already setup you can follow these steps:

1. [Install the GNU privacy Guard (GPG)](https://gnupg.org)
1. [Generate a new GPG
   key](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
1. [Add your key to your GitHub
   account](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)
1. [Set your signing key in
   Git](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/telling-git-about-your-signing-key)

## Step 0: determine what type of release you are cutting

Major releases are for new feature additions and behavioral changes that break
backwards compatibility. Minor releases are for new feature additions that do
not break backwards compatibility. Patch releases are for bug fixes that do not
introduce any new features.

There are two versions of the checklist: one for patch releases, and one for
major/minor releases. Follow the checklist that best applies below.

## Checklist for major and minor releases

Follow this checklist if you are cutting a major release (vX.0.0) or a minor
release (vX.Y.0):

1. set up your environment
1. increment the version number
1. finalize the release and write the release notes

In this checklist, we are going to reference a few environment variables which
you will want to set for convenience.

For major and minor releases, set the following environment variables, changing
the values of `$MAJOR_RELEASE_NUMBER`, `$MINOR_RELEASE_NUMBER`, and
`$RELEASE_CANDIDATE_NUMBER` accordingly:

```console
export MAJOR_RELEASE_NUMBER="0"
export MINOR_RELEASE_NUMBER="1"
export RELEASE_NAME="v${MAJOR_RELEASE_NUMBER}.${MINOR_RELEASE_NUMBER}.0"
```

Create a new tag from upstream's `main` branch.

```console
git fetch upstream main
git checkout upstream/main
git tag --sign --annotate "${RELEASE_NAME}" --message "Hippo release ${RELEASE_NAME}"
```

Double-check one last time to make sure everything is in order, then finally
push the release tag.

```console
git push upstream $RELEASE_NAME
```

It is usually more beneficial to the end-user if the release notes are
hand-written by a human being/marketing team/dog, so we'll go ahead and write up
the release notes.

If you're releasing a major/minor release, listing notable user-facing features
is usually sufficient. For patch releases, do the same, but make note of the
symptoms causing the original issue, who may be affected, and how the patch
mitigates the issue.

It should look like this:

```markdown
## Hippo vX.Y.Z

Hippo vX.Y.Z is a feature release. This release, we focused on <insert focal point here>. Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.

## Notable features/changes

- TLS auto-registration support has been added
- Improved error handling in the API

## Breaking changes

No known breaking changes were introduced this release.

## Known issues/missing features

- Needs more cowbell
- I gotta have more cowbell!

## Installation

Download Hippo vX.Y.Z:

- [checksums-vX.Y.Z.txt](https://hippo.blob.core.windows.net/releases/checksums-vX.Y.Z.txt)
- [hippo-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz](https://hippo.blob.core.windows.net/releases/hippo-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz)
```

Feel free to bring in your own personality into the release notes; it's nice
for people to think we're not all robots. :)

Double check the URLs are correct. Once finished, go into GitHub and edit the
release notes for the tagged release with the notes written here.

It is now worth getting other people to take a look at the release notes before
the release is published. It is always beneficial as it can be easy to miss
something.

For pre-v1.0 releases, make sure to check the checkbox that says "This is a
pre-release" to notify users that this release is identified as non-production
ready.

When you are ready to go, hit `publish`, and you're done.

## Checklist for patch releases

Follow this checklist if you are cutting a patch release (vX.Y.Z). The process
is largely the same as cutting a major/minor release, but with a few
differences.

1. set up your environment
1. increment the version number
1. cherry-pick fixes
1. finalize the release and write the release notes

In this checklist, we are going to reference a few environment variables which
you will want to set for convenience.

For patch releases, set the following environment variables:

```console
export MAJOR_RELEASE_NUMBER="0"
export MINOR_RELEASE_NUMBER="1"
export PATCH_RELEASE_NUMBER="1"
export PREVIOUS_PATCH_RELEASE_NUMBER="0"
export RELEASE_NAME="v${MAJOR_RELEASE_NUMBER}.${MINOR_RELEASE_NUMBER}.${PATCH_RELEASE_NUMBER}"
export PREVIOUS_RELEASE_NAME="v${MAJOR_RELEASE_NUMBER}.${MINOR_RELEASE_NUMBER}.${PREVIOUS_PATCH_RELEASE_NUMBER}"
export RELEASE_BRANCH_NAME="release-${MAJOR_RELEASE_NUMBER}.${MINOR_RELEASE_NUMBER}.${PATCH_RELEASE_NUMBER}"
```

Check out the previous tag from upstream and use it to create a new branch:

```console
git fetch upstream --tags
git checkout $PREVIOUS_RELEASE_NAME
git checkout -b $RELEASE_BRANCH_NAME
```

Once that's done, make sure to cherry-pick the fixes into this branch:

```console
git cherry-pick -x <commit_id>
```

If anyone is available, let others peer-review the branch before continuing to
ensure that all the proper fixes have been merged into the release branch.

When you're finally happy with the quality of the release branch, you can move
on and create the tag. Double-check one last time to make sure everything is in
order, then finally push the release tag.

```console
git tag --sign --annotate "${RELEASE_NAME}" --message "Hippo release ${RELEASE_NAME}"
git push upstream $RELEASE_NAME
```

It is usually more beneficial to the end-user if the release notes are
hand-written by a human being/marketing team/dog, so we'll go ahead and write
up the release notes.

For patch releases, make note of the symptoms causing the original issue(s),
who may be affected, and how the patch(es) mitigate the issue(s).

It should look like this:

```markdown
## Hippo vX.Y.Z

Hippo vX.Y.Z is a patch release, fixing an issue where <insert disagnosis of issue here>.

This patch fixes this issue by <insert remedy here>.

Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.

## Breaking changes

No known breaking changes were introduced this release.
